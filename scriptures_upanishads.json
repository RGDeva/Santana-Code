  "description": "The Upanishads are among the best-known philosophical-religious works in the world and also among the oldest as the earliest texts are thought to have been composed between 800-500 BCE. These works are philosophical dialogues relating to the concepts expressed by the Vedas, the central scriptures of Hinduism. The Upanishads are referred to as Vedanta – 'the end of the Vedas' – in that they complete the sacred revelation received by the sages.",

          "translation": "As a lump of salt thrown in water dissolves and cannot be taken out again, though wherever we taste the water it is salty, even so, the separate self dissolves in the sea of pure consciousness, infinite and immortal. Separateness arises from identifying the Self with the body, which is made up of elements; when this physical identification dissolves, there can be no more separate self.",
          "explanation": "This famous passage uses the analogy of salt dissolving in water to illustrate how the individual self (Atman) merges with the universal consciousness (Brahman). Just as the salt becomes one with the water while still imparting its essence throughout, the individual self merges with the divine while still maintaining its essential nature."
