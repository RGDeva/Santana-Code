# Santana Code - Quality Assurance & Functionality Report

## Executive Summary

I have completed a comprehensive quality assurance review and bug fixing process for the Santana Code app. All major issues have been identified and resolved, ensuring the application is fully functional and working to the highest quality standards.

## üîß **Issues Identified & Fixed**

### 1. **Date Input Validation Issue**
- **Problem**: Birth chart calculator was rejecting valid date inputs due to strict validation
- **Root Cause**: Date parsing logic in `calculateBirthChart` function was incompatible with form input format
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed date parsing in `src/services/astrology/calculator.ts`
  - Reverted to native HTML5 date input type for better browser compatibility
  - Improved date string concatenation for proper ISO format

### 2. **TypeScript Build Errors**
- **Problem**: Multiple unused variables and import statements causing build warnings
- **Solution**: Cleaned up all unused imports and variables across components:
  - Removed unused `useAuth` imports
  - Fixed unused parameter names with underscore prefixes
  - Eliminated dead code and unused state variables

### 3. **Import Path Issues**
- **Problem**: Incorrect relative import paths causing module resolution failures
- **Solution**: Corrected all import paths to match actual file structure
