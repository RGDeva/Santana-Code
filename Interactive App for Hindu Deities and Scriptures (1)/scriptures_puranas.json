      "description": "The Puranas are a vast genre of Indian literature that include legends, mythology, genealogies of gods and kings, cosmology, philosophy, and various traditional lore. Several of these texts are named after major Hindu deities such as Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, and Devi.",
      "historical_context": "The first versions of various Puranas were likely composed between the 3rd and 10th century CE, though they existed in oral form before being written down. The Puranas shaped Hinduism more than the Vedas, providing a 'culture synthesis' in weaving and integrating the diverse beliefs of many local traditions.",
      "summary": "The Puranas are encyclopedic texts that cover diverse topics such as cosmogony, cosmology, genealogies of gods, goddesses, kings, heroes, sages, folk tales, pilgrimages, temples, medicine, astronomy, grammar, mineralogy, humor, love stories, theology, and philosophy. They are traditionally attributed to the sage Vyasa but are likely the work of many authors over centuries. The content is highly inconsistent across the Puranas, and each Purana has survived in numerous manuscripts which are themselves inconsistent. There are 18 Mahapuranas (Major Puranas) and 18 Upapuranas (Minor Puranas), with over 400,000 verses in total.",
