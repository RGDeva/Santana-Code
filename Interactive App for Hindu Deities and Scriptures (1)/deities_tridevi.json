The river's ability to nurture civilization along its banks became metaphorically linked to how knowledge nurtures the human mind and soul."

She meditated in the harsh Himalayan climate, enduring extreme heat in summer and cold in winter. She reduced her diet to leaves and eventually gave up food entirely. Her devotion and determination impressed the gods, and finally caught Shiva's attention. After testing her devotion in various ways, including appearing as an old sage to criticize himself, Shiva was convinced of her love and accepted her as his consort."

When Shiva returned and tried to enter, the boy, not knowing who Shiva was, refused him entry. Enraged, Shiva cut off the boy's head. Seeing this, Parvati was devastated and demanded that Shiva restore her son to life. Shiva sent his followers to bring back the head of the first creature they encountered, which was an elephant. Shiva attached the elephant head to the boy's body, reviving him, and named him Ganesha, making him the lord of his followers (Ganas)."
