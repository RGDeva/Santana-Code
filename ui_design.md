# Santana Code - Mystical UI/UX Design Document

## Design Philosophy

Santana Code's UI design is inspired by the following principles:

1. **Minimalist Elegance**: Drawing from Naval Ravikant's philosophy of minimalism, the design eliminates unnecessary elements to focus on what truly matters. Each screen has a clear purpose with minimal distractions.

2. **Timeless Aesthetic**: The interface feels ancient yet modern, using design elements that transcend trends and connect to the eternal nature of Sanatana Dharma.

3. **Scripturally Grounded**: Visual elements are derived from authentic scriptural symbolism rather than clich√©d representations.

4. **Meditative Experience**: The app creates a sense of calm and presence, with thoughtful transitions, comfortable reading spaces, and mindful interactions.

5. **Mystical yet Functional**: While maintaining an air of mystery and depth, the interface remains highly usable and intuitive.
